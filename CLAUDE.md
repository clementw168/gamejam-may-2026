# Verdant Depths — Game Jam 2026

Roguelite dungeon crawler, forest-ruins theme. Built with pygame-ce.

## Run

```
uv run verdant-depths [--keys arrows|wasd|zqsd]
```

## Architecture

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `constants.py` | All magic numbers (screen size, colours, speeds, radii, boss stats) |
| `config.py` | Runtime config — key layout (`--keys` flag) |
| `sounds.py` | Procedural audio synthesis + asset file override |
| `main.py` | pygame init, mixer pre-init, `sounds.init()`, game loop |
| `game.py` | State machine: **MENU** / PLAYING ↔ TRANSITIONING / UPGRADE / SHOP / FLOOR_CLEAR / RELIC / VICTORY / DEAD / **ARENA_SELECT** / **ARENA_RELIC_SELECT** / **ARENA** / ARENA_WIN / ARENA_DEAD / **ENDLESS_SELECT** / **ENDLESS** / ENDLESS_BETWEEN / ENDLESS_DEAD; dungeon nav, gate blocking, coin drops, floor progression, boss spawn, summon drain, pack wave roll, run-stats tracking, high-score I/O |
| `camera.py` | World↔screen transform + screen shake |
| `rooms.py` | Tile grid, 9 templates (5 base + 4 underground-ruin), collision, `find_spawn_near_centre`, door tile cuts, `get_spawn_positions` with `exclude_pos` |
| `dungeon.py` | DFS room graph, BFS boss detection, floor-weighted template selection |
| `player.py` | Movement, dash (SPACE, i-frames), shoot (LMB), per-run stats, relic flags |
| `perks.py` | 12 `Perk` dataclasses; each has `apply(player)` callback |
| `enemies.py` | All 13 regular enemies + 6 bosses + SporeElder elite; `Enemy` base with `_steer_toward`, `_move`, `tick_status`, status effect timers |
| `relics.py` | 20 `Relic` dataclasses; each has `apply(player)` callback; `RELIC_POOL` list |
| `projectiles.py` | Arrow (speed/damage/piercing/bouncing/overcharged kwargs, `hit_enemies` set), EnemyProjectile (homing, leech_owner flags) |
| `particles.py` | Lightweight particle pool, named presets (inc. boss death/phase-2 bursts) |
| `ui.py` | HUD, minimap (20×11 px cells), **main menu**, death/victory/floor-clear/relic screens, upgrade chooser, shop screen, **boss HP bar**, **boss-gate hint**, **arena relic select** |

## Layout

- Screen: 1280×720
- Tile: 32 px — room is exactly 40×20 tiles = 1280×640
- Bottom 80 px = HUD strip
- Border wall: **1 tile thick** (row 0 / row 19 / col 0 / col 39)
- Door opening: 3 tiles wide, centred — cols 19–21 (N/S) or rows 9–11 (E/W)
- Camera offset = (0, 0) per room; shake handled by `Camera`; smooth-step pan during TRANSITIONING

## Dungeon

- DFS random walk from (0,0) → `max(5, floor+4)`–`min(14, floor+6)` rooms per floor, tree topology
- Boss room = BFS-farthest node from start (follows actual door connections); shop room = random non-start, non-boss room
- Room transitions: PLAYING → TRANSITIONING (0.38 s smooth-step pan) → PLAYING (or SHOP)
- Template selection: F1 draws from templates 0–4; each deeper floor unlocks one more (up to all 9 at F5+)
- Minimap: top-right overlay; gold = current, green = cleared, red = boss, teal = shop

## Door rules

- **Closed** (room not cleared): gate bars drawn flush with the border tile; player blocked at wall face
- **Open** (room cleared): player walks through; exit triggers when centre crosses wall face threshold
- Exit detection checks **lateral position** to prevent wall-corner false triggers
- **Boss gate**: blocks movement until ALL non-boss rooms cleared; shows extra bars + hint tooltip on bump

## Enemies

| Enemy | Type | Floor | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GoblinRunner | melee chaser | all | `_steer_toward` wall-aware movement; HP 3+; 2 coins |

### Enemy movement system (`enemies.py`)

- **`Enemy._steer_toward(tx, ty, room)`** — 8-direction wall-aware probe (scores by goal alignment − wall penalty); returns `(vx, vy)` at `self.speed`. Used by GoblinRunner, Wolf (approach), StoneCrawler, MagmaSlug.
- **Erratic blend** (VenomfangBat, VoidShrieker) — `_wander_angle` shifts ±90° every 0.6 s; movement = 70% steered + 30% wander, then existing wobble applied on top.

### Status effects (`Enemy.tick_status`)

Poison · Slow · Burn · Stun · Bleed timers on every enemy. DoT ticks every 0.5 s; stun freezes movement; slow ×0.4 speed. Colour-coded status rings drawn around affected enemies. Applied by: Venom Gland relic (poison), Phase Cloak relic (stun), MagmaSlug BurnPatch (burn via `game.py`).

### Spawn system (`game.py`)

- **`_spawn_wave`** — mixed enemy table indexed by floor; counts scale F1–F7; accepts `exclude_pos` to keep enemies ≥200 px from player entry point
- **`_pack_wave`** — 20% chance from floor 2+; spawns 3–7 of one type (runner/wolf always; bat F4+; turret F5+; shrieker F7)
- **Entry grace period** — 0.5 s iframes granted on every room transition commit (ancient_sigil bumps to 1.0 s)

### Target run structure

| Floor | Rooms | Boss |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 5–7 | Goblin Shaman |
| 2 | 6–8 | Goblin Shaman (harder) |

| 4 | 8–10 | Iron Warden |
| 5 | 9–11 | Abyssal Leech |
| 6 | 10–12 | Fungal Matriarch |
| 7 | 11–13 | Void Sovereign |

## Shop

- One room per floor (never start, never boss); entered automatically on transition
- **Slot 1** Heart Vial — restore 1 HP, 5 coins (reusable while HP < max)
- **Slots 2–3** — two random perks (filtered for already-applied one-shots), 8 coins each
- Press `1`/`2`/`3` to buy; `Space` to leave; shop re-opens on re-entry

## Floor progression

- 7 floors total; boss room on each floor
- Boss gate: bars + movement block until all non-boss rooms cleared
- Boss cleared → `FLOOR_CLEAR` overlay → `RELIC` pick → floor advances (new `Dungeon`, `room_num` resets, player stats preserved)
- Floor 7 boss cleared → `VICTORY` screen

## Endless Mode

Accessible from the main menu with `E`. No coins, no shop, no floor structure — pure wave survival.

### States
- `ENDLESS_SELECT` — wave-selection screen (pick starting multiple of 5: 0, 5, 10 … 35)
- `ENDLESS` — sealed room combat (all doors locked, full relic/perk effects active)
- `ENDLESS_BETWEEN` — between-wave overlay (rewards displayed; Space to continue)
- `ENDLESS_DEAD` — player died; press R to return to menu

### 5-wave cycle structure
| Wave in cycle | Reward |
|---|---|
| 1 | +1 HP |
| 2 | +1 HP + choose a perk |
| 3 | +1 HP |
| 4 | +1 HP |
| 5 (boss) | Full HP restore + choose a relic |

### Difficulty scaling
- Virtual floor = `min(7, 1 + cycle)` where cycle is 0-indexed (wave 1–5 = cycle 0, wave 6–10 = cycle 1 …)
- Room depth = `min(3, position_in_cycle + 1)` → enemy composition uses existing `_spawn_wave(room, vfloor, depth)`
- Boss waves cycle through all 7 campaign bosses then repeat
- After cycle 6 (wave 35+), difficulty stays at max floor 7 with room_depth=3

### Starting from a higher wave
- Player selects a multiple of 5 (e.g. 10); first fight is wave 11
- Pre-selects N/5 perks + N/5 relics before combat starts (using existing UPGRADE/RELIC screens)
- `_endless_mode = True` flag causes `_pick_perk`/`_pick_relic` to return to endless flow instead of `PLAYING`
- Pre-pick queue: `['perk', 'relic']` × cycles_completed; processed one at a time before first wave

### Selection screen controls
| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| ◄ / ► (or Left/Right arrows) | Decrease / increase starting wave by 5 |
| Space / Enter | Start fight |
| Esc | Back to menu |

## High score & menus

- **State flow**: `MENU` → any key → `PLAYING`; death/victory `R` → `MENU`
- **Menu screen**: title, tagline, controls table, best-run panel
- **Run stats**: floors reached, rooms cleared (combat only), coins collected (gross), elapsed time
- **Death / victory overlays**: full stats + "✦ NEW BEST RUN! ✦" banner when applicable
- **High score file**: `~/.verdant-depths/highscore.json`; comparison: floors → rooms → coins

## Room templates (`rooms.py`)

9 templates in `TEMPLATES` list. Floor-weighted unlock: F1 uses templates 0–4; each deeper floor adds one more.

| Index | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | arena | Open with corner pillars + centre rock |
| 1 | columns | Six slender columns symmetrically placed |
| 2 | lshapes | L-shaped rubble in four inner corners |
| 3 | maze | Two horizontal wall segments with gaps |
| 4 | island | Large centre island + side cover rocks |
| 5 | corridor | Vertical dividers with 3-tile choke passages (F2+) |
| 6 | pit_ring | Large impassable central pit, ring walkway (F3+) |
| 7 | rubble_heap | Asymmetric scatter of wall blocks (F4+) |
| 8 | pillars_dense | 12 single-tile sight-breaking pillars (F5+) |

## Coin economy

### Enemy coin drops

All regular enemies drop a **flat 2 coins** to reduce room-to-room variance and simplify balancing. Bosses keep themed values.

| Type | Drop |
|---|---|
| All regular enemies | **2** |
| Goblin Shaman | 10 |
| Ancient Tree | 15 |
| Iron Warden | 18 |
| Abyssal Leech | 20 |
| Fungal Matriarch | 22 |
| Void Sovereign | 30 |

### Expected income per floor

Computed from: `randint(max(5, F+4), min(14, F+6))` total rooms → subtract 3 (start + shop + boss) combat rooms; assume depth-3 wave for all but first 2 rooms.

| Floor | Rooms (avg) | Combat rooms | Enemies/room | Coins/room | ~Floor income |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 6 | 3 | 5 | 10 | 40 |
| 2 | 7 | 4 | 7 | 14 | 66 |
| 3 | 8 | 5 | 10 | 20 | 115 |
| 4 | 9 | 6 | 12 | 24 | 162 |
| 5 | 10 | 7 | 17 | 34 | 258 |
| 6 | 11 | 8 | 20 | 40 | 342 |
| 7 | 12 | 9 | 27 | 54 | 516 |

### Shop prices (per floor, `constants.py` `SHOP_HP_PRICE` / `SHOP_PERK_PRICE`)

Shop has **1 HP Vial** (reusable while HP < max) + **1 Perk card** — 2 slots, forcing a trade-off. Both items together target ≈ 50–85 % of expected floor income.

Prices set so HP + Perk ≈ expected floor income (30/70 split). Clearing all combat rooms lets you afford exactly one of each.

| Floor | Income | HP Vial | Perk | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 40 | 10 | 30 | 40 |
| 2 | 66 | 20 | 45 | 65 |
| 3 | 115 | 35 | 80 | 115 |
| 4 | 162 | 50 | 115 | 165 |
| 5 | 258 | 75 | 180 | 255 |
| 6 | 342 | 105 | 240 | 345 |
| 7 | 516 | 155 | 360 | 515 |

### Relic healing per floor (post-nerf)

| Floor | Coin-Fed Heart (100c/HP) | Leech Stone (50 kills/HP) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.4 HP | 0.3 HP |
| 2 | 0.7 HP | 0.6 HP |
| 3 | 1.2 HP | 1.0 HP |
| 4 | 1.6 HP | 1.5 HP |
| 5 | 2.6 HP | 2.4 HP |
| 6 | 3.4 HP | 3.2 HP |
| 7 | 5.2 HP | 4.9 HP |

## Known issues (all fixed)

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ~~Flag-based perks offered again after applied~~ | `_available_perks(player)` filters `piercing_shot`/`double_shot` before sampling |
| 2 | ~~Minimap cells too small (14×7 px)~~ | `CW, CH` bumped to 20×11 in `ui.draw_minimap` |
| 3 | ~~GoblinShaman double HP bar~~ | Removed redundant bars; `ui.draw_boss_hpbar()` is sole source of truth |

## Arena Mode

Accessible from the main menu with `A`. A standalone 1v1 (or 1vN) practice mode — no perks, no shop, no floor progression. One optional relic can be chosen before each fight.

## Design ideas (not implemented)

| Idea | Description |
|---|---|
| **Rebound enemy** | Dashes toward player the moment it takes a hit — punishes reckless shooting |
| **Mid-dash steering** | Blend held movement keys into dash direction at ~30%/frame during active window |
